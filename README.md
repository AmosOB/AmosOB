- ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amos Babu, and I'm from Kenya. I am a web designer and developer who can effectively handle both the front end and the back end of a project. :+1: - I'm interested in continuing my study of the Python language primarily because I seem to really enjoy its machine language. I also enjoy creating websites, so I keep learning new frameworks.
I'm now studying the machine language of Python, as well as React.js and Django, which is used for web development.
