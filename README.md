I'm Amos Babu from Kenya. As a web developer and designer, I am able to effectively manage both the front and back ends of a project. My primary programming tools are the ReactJS library and the Laravel framework.
One of the reasons I want to continue learning Python is my obvious love for its machine language. Because I enjoy developing web applications so much, I'm continuously learning new frameworks.
Currently, I'm learning Python machine language and web development with Django.
