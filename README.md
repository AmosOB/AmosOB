üêã I go by Amos Babu and am from Kenya. I can effectively manage both the front end and back end of a project because I am a web developer and designer. My main programming tools are the Reactjs library and the Laravel framework.
My apparent appreciation for Python's machine language is one of the reasons I wish to continue studying it. Because I enjoy making web apps so much, I'm constantly picking up new frameworks.
Right now, I'm learning Python machine language and web development using Django.
