I'm Amos Babu. As a web developer, I can effectively manage both the front and back ends of a project. My main programming tools are Javascript and PHP, notably the Framework ReactJS library and Laravel. 
I also program in Python, and one of the reasons I want to continue studying it is my obvious excitement for the machine language.
The whole journey of programming is learning new things and that I enjoy .
