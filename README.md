ðŸ‘‹ My name is Amos Babu, and I'm from Kenya. I am a web designer and developer who can manage both the front end and back end of a project effectively.
I'm interested in continuing my Python studies partly because I appear to appreciate its machine language. I really adore building websites, therefore I am constantly learning new frameworks.
I'm now learning Python's machine language, as well as React.js and Django, which are used for web development.
